# My Technical Questions Responses for my EDIT AI/ML Application

## Overview
This repository contains my responses to the technical questions provided as part of my EDIT AI/ML Internship application. The responses cover various aspects of programming, statistical analysis, and problem-solving using Python and R.

## Contents
- `src/` contains all source code files.
  - `functional_programming.py` and `functional_programming.R`: Functions in Python and R to calculate mean, standard deviation, and count.
  - `statistical_analysis.py`: Proportion calculation above a threshold.
  - `oop_python.py`: Example of object-oriented programming in Python.
  - `data_plotting.py`: Script to create a histogram of gene expression values.

## How to Run the Code
Ensure you have Python and R installed on your machine.
- For Python scripts, run `python filename.py` in your terminal.
- For R scripts, run the script using an R environment, such as RStudio.
